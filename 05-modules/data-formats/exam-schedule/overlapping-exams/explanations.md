# Explanations

Write a script that looks for students with two exams at the same moment.
Each exam takes place on a certain day, in a certain "part of day" (morning, afternoon of evening).
Two exams overlap if they share both day and part of day.

Print a list of students with overlapping exams, together
with the number of overlapping exams and the time this overlap occurs.
Run the solution on the data to get example output.
